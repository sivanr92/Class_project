This project has the codes and materials for the subfamily classification of a CAZyme family.


<b>Project title: Subfamily classification and analysis of CAZy family</b>

<b>Goal: Classify the CAZy family into subfamilies, analyze and visualize them using Bioinformatics tools and methods.</b> 

In this tutorial, CAZy family GH31 was used to explain bioinformatics methods to analyze and visualize them.

<h4>Steps involved and methods to identify the subfamily from a CAZy family: </h4>
<ol>
<li>Dataset and preprocess</li>
<li>Domain annotation using HMM and dbCAN</li>
<li> Extraction of modules (based on the annotation) </li>
<li>Construction of sequence similarity networks (SSN) using SSNpipe and analyzing SSNs based on characterized IDs from CAZy and EC numbers. </li>
<li> Visualization of SSN networks using Cytoscape </li>
<li> Phylogenentic analysis </li>
<li> Interpretation and discussion</li>
</ol>
